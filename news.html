        <div id="articeltext">
          <p class="textsize2" style="color: gray;">January 25, 2023 marks 7 years of the 2nd Elstreet world. During these 7 years, 
            Elstreet has grown from just being a single small village, to a collection of 33 states with over 60 villages in-total.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="textsize2" style="color: gray;">As a community, while it has never been the most active or sustaining, 
            about 20 individuals have at one point joined the server. Out of the 20 people, about a handful of them continued to play, 
            and they have contributed greatly to the server's growth and identity.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="textsize2" style="color: gray;">Most Minecraft servers would cease to exist after a while, mostly due to inactivity, 
            or just simply because of an update that turns the server irrelevant. But somehow Elstreet manages to continue forward, 
            with its many waves of ups and downs.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="textsize2" style="color: gray;">As the host of the server, I will for as long as Minecraft and good hope will allow me, 
            continue to make sure that the server will stay online and available to anyone.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="textsize2" style="color: gray;">May Elstreet continue to see many more years in the future, and thank you to all who have become a part of this journey.</p>

        <p align="center" style="font-size: 18;">Building Arcadia</p>
        <br>

        <div id="articeltext">
          <p class="textsize2" style="color: gray;">Since September 18, 2021, Arcadia has been viewed as the peak of discovery back when lots of new terrain was being mapped out. 
            Arcadia is a large, continent sized island in the middle of a vast ocean with a dynamic range of landscapes and features, 
            all of which is completely isolated from civilization or at least for now.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="textsize2" style="color: gray;">Therefore, it is surprising that not much was done in Arcadia since its discovery, 
            similar to how the other massive amounts of land that were discovered are still for the most part untouched.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="textsize2" style="color: gray;">But starting in Early August 2022, the server's Host The Bandit714 has been making considerable efforts to develop Arcadia 
            into an isolated beacon of civilization. The past 2 months worth of development has resulted in a road network spanning almost 
            the entire island, the beginnings of a small rail network, several new towns and cities established, and most significantly 
            the building of the main city in Arcadia called Dawn.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="textsize2" style="color: gray;">What started as a generic, naturally generated village, has turned into a bustling city that is currently in its heyday of growth and expansion. 
            Along its development there are several notable buildings in the city including its bank, library, train station, church, 
            factory, riverside dock, a lighthouse, and a couple of shops.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="textsize2" style="color: gray;">Even with all things that have been built, there is still plenty of room for Dawn to continue growing and become 
            one of the most iconic cities on the server, possibly rivaling Elstreet City. 
            And that is just one area located in Arcadia, there are another 4 villages that have currently seen little development, 
            and many areas of land that can either be turned into more towns or be bought up by people who may be seeking for large property.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="textsize2" style="color: gray;">Only time will tell if this growing state will become a significant force on the server or will the boom slowly turn into a bust.</p>
