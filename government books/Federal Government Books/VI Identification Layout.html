    <h3>Section 1: ID Layout</h3>
    <p>
      An ID shall be laid out with the following. The personâ€™s gamertag, ID number, the County and Town name that the person is living in, and the date of when the ID is signed.
	    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All IDs must be signed by either the Host or one of the CO Hosts in order to become a finished and valid ID.
    </p>

    <h3>Section 2: ID Number</h3>
    <p>
      The ID number shall contain 3 sets of digits. The first set being the State where the person's primary home is located. The second set of digits is a counter for how many people have joined the world. The third set of digits is a 5 digit number that is completely randomized and is unique to that person in that particular State.
	    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the person's primary home is not in a State or district that has a number, then they will be given the number 0 for the first set of digits.
    </p>
