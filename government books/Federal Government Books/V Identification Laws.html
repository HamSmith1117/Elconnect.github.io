    </p>

    <h3>Section 2</h3>
    <p>
      Throughout the several States there shall be ID offices that will manage all IDs within their designated areas.
	    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People working in these ID looks may be hired by the State or the Federal Government, and will be viewed as Federal Employees.
	    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an ID is lost, needs to be updated or needs to be created, or any other related subjects, then the person may go to their local ID office.
	    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All IDs must be signed by either the Host or one of the CO Hosts in order to become a finished and valid ID.
    </p>

    <h3>Section 3</h3>
    <p>
      Stealing, and or using someone else’s ID will be viewed is highly illegal with a possibility of a band or kick from the world.
	    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ID that is not signed by any of the Host and CO Host, will be viewed as a fake ID and will be highly illegal if proven guilty of using one, with a punishment of a band or kick from the world.
	    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person’s gamer tag, job profession (if their ID states job profession), ID number, and or if the person's primary home location needs to be changed.

	    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using an invalid ID shall have less of a harsh punishment than using a fake ID or stolen ID, as long as that person was the original owner of the said invalid ID.
