      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the person elected Mayor decides to drop out of office or is not sworn in on time, then a special election for a new Mayor must be held.

    <h3>Section 3: Federal Voting Laws</h3>
    <p>
      To vote in any Federal or State elections, a person must be a citizen of Elstreet, and must present their ID when voting.  A person can only vote in the State and or Jurisdiction that is listed on their ID.
	    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who votes more than once in the election held in both the State and Federal level, or deposits more than one ballot for the same office as his or her vote at such election, or knowingly attempts to vote when not entitled to do so, shall be guilty under fraudulent voting.
	    <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;States may have control on where the voting both will be and how the ballot will look when voting, but all ballots must contain all official candidates running in their respective election.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person may only run for one election at a time.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an incumbent of one office fails to win a different office while their office was also up for election, then they will lose both offices, since they can only run for one office at a time.
